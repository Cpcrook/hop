Progress so far:

## App

- Upon click a button the hash changes

To do:

- Hash change needs to translate to a model change
- Create a nice DSL for storing routes
- Instead of changing the route by passing #/users, change it by using an object?

The router model:

### Definition



### Path

- Need to create the path in a terse way, navigate by route name?
e.g. navigate "users", userId: 1

### Query

- Need to replace totally
- Or add
- params will be a hash

- We need replace or add

### TODO for url

- Parse Url into data structure
- Convert data structure into url

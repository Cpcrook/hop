Progress so far:

## App2

- Upon click a button the hash changes

To do:

- Convert this hash change to an action
- Listen for manual hash changes and convert to actions
- Hash change needs to translate to a model change
- Create a nice DSL for storing routes
- Instead of changing the route by passing #/users, change it by using an object?
